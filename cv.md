## Hello World!

I am a software developer with just about 10 years of professional experience.
My main focus is on development and maintenance of performance-sensitive backend applications.
I consider myself to be language-agnostic, and have both personal and professional experience
with a wide range of technologies.
Having worked almost exclusively in teams with other developers, I think of myself
as a strong team player.
